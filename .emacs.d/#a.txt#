This
variable
may
be
risky
if
used
as
a
file-local
variable.

Documentation:
List
of
directories
to
search
for
files
to
load.
Each
element
is
a
string
(directory
file
name)
or
nil
(meaning
‘default-directory’).
This
list
is
consulted
by
the
‘require’
function.
Initialized
during
startup
as
described
in
Info
node
‘(elisp)Library
Search’.
Use
‘directory-file-name’
when
adding
items
to
this
path.

However,
Lisp
programs
that
process
this
list
should
tolerate
directories
both
with
and
without
trailing
slashes.
